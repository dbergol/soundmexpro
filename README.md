****************************************************************************

The source code archive of SoundMexPro contains all source code files and
C++-Builder project files (*.cbproj) to compile all executables and libraries
of SoundMexPro. If not stated differently in separate _README.txt files within 
a projects subdirectory all projects were compiled using Embarcadero C++-Builder. 
They were compiled using "Steema TChart Pro", but special features of the "Pro" 
version are not used within SoundMexPro. You might need to ignore errors and/or 
remove unsupported options from the *.DFM files for a successful build using 
"Steema TChart Standard" shipped with C++-Builder.
You might need to adjust paths and/or 3rd party source code files and/or libraries 
within the project files for a successful build. The project files each contain 
two target platforms, Win32 and Win64 for 32bit and 64bit respectively

Please extract the Development-directory conained in the archive to the installation 
directory of SoundMexPro. Files from the "mex" directory of the installation will be
needed for compiling SoundMexPro. Read the contained _README.txt carefully.

Binaries (installers) are available on the SoundMexPro homepage https://www.soundmexpro.de
